FILM PROMO SITE
This is just an idea I had
I wanted to create a simple website that could serve
as a promo for a fictional horror film
This project is for practice and educational
purposes

IMPROVEMENTS:
-Research some reference websites from upcoming horror
films (IMDB) and put together a better design in Adobe XD,
Figma or other software

-Add more images and graphical elements from sources like
UNSPLASH or PEXELS, do some editing in Photoshop

-Implement smooth scrolling

-Implement a photo gallery
